#What it should have been:
  It should have been an app with a Calender, Task tracking and Expance/Income tracking capabilities.
  #But 
  @vladosstrawberry underastimated our abilities. Also he had made several mistakes that led to the death of the project.
  1. Bad marketing research was done. Missed several apps with the same functionality, somewhere better than in our idea.
  2. Lack of human, social and financial capital.
  3. Bad architecture, that led to unmaintability
